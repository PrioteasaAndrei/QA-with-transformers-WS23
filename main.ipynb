      "importance high dose omega 3 docosahexaenoic acid dha supplementation of children born at less than 29 weeks gestation has been shown to improve iq despite increasing the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd given that bpd is associated with poorer cognitive outcomes it is unclear whether the increased risk of bpd with dha supplementation is associated with decreased benefit to iq objective to investigate whether the increased risk of bpd with dha supplementation was associated with diminished iq benefit design setting and participants this cohort study used data collected from a multicenter blinded randomized controlled trial of dha supplementation in children born at less than 29 weeks gestation participants were recruited from 2012 to 2015 and followed up until 5 years corrected age data were analyzed from november 2022 to february 2023 interventions enteral dha emulsion 60 mg kg d to match the estimated in utero requirement or a control emulsion from the first 3 days of enteral feeds until 36 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge home main outcomes and measures physiological bpd was assessed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age iq was assessed at 5 years corrected age using the wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence 4th edition children from the 5 highest recruiting australian hospitals were assessed the total effect of dha supplementation on iq was divided into direct and indirect effects using mediation analysis with bpd as the presumed mediating variable results among 656 surviving children from hospitals involved in iq follow up mean sd gestational age at birth 26 8 1 4 weeks 346 males 52 7 there were 323 children with dha supplementation and 333 children in the control group mean iq was 3 45 points 95 ci 0 38 to 6 53 points higher in the dha group than the control group despite an increase in the risk of bpd 160 children 49 7 vs 143 children 42 8 with bpd the indirect effect of dha on iq via bpd was not statistically significant 0 17 points 95 ci 0 62 to 0 13 points with most of the effect of dha on iq occurring independently of bpd direct effect 3 62 points 95 ci 0 55 to 6 81 points conclusions and relevance this study found that associations of dha with bpd and iq were largely independent this finding suggests that if clinicians supplement children born preterm with high dose dha any resulting increase in bpd risk would not be associated with meaningful reductions in the iq benefit\n",

      "introduction globally preterm birth has replaced congenital malformation as the major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity the reduced rate of congenital malformation was not achieved through a single biophysical or biochemical marker at a specific gestational age but rather through a combination of clinical biophysical and biochemical markers at different gestational ages since the aetiology of spontaneous preterm birth is also multifactorial it is unlikely that a single biomarker test at a specific gestational age will emerge as the definitive predictive test methods the biomarkers group of prebic comprising clinicians basic scientists and other experts in the field with a particular interest in preterm birth have produced this commentary with short medium and long term aims i to alert clinicians to the advances that are being made in the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ii to encourage clinicians and scientists to continue their efforts in this field and not to be disheartened or nihilistic because of a perceived lack of progress and iii to enable development of novel interventions that can reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth results using language that we hope is clear to practising clinicians we have identified 11 sections in which there exists the potential feasibility and capability of technologies for candidate biomarkers in the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth and how current limitations to this research might be circumvented discussion the combination of biophysical biochemical immunological microbiological fetal cell exosomal or cell free rna at different gestational ages integrated as part of a multivariable predictor model may be necessary to advance our attempts to predict sptl and ptb this will require systems biological data using omics data and artificial intelligence machine learning to manage the data appropriately the ultimate goal is to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth\n",

      "purpose of review this article reviews recent advances and controversies of developmental anesthesia neurotoxicity research with a special focus on the unanswered questions in the field both from clinical and preclinical perspectives recent findings observational cohort studies of prenatal and early childhood exposure to anesthesia have reported mixed evidence of an association with impaired neurodevelopment meta analyses of currently available studies of early childhood exposure to anesthesia suggest that while limited to no change in general intelligence can be detected more subtle deficits in specific neurodevelopmental domains including behavior and executive function may be seen several studies have evaluated intraoperative blood pressure values and neurocognitive outcomes and have not found an association although many animal studies have been performed taking into consideration other peri operative exposures such as pain and inflammation may help with translation of results from animal models to humans summary advances have been made in the field of developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity over the past few years including the recognition that anesthetic exposure is associated with deficits in certain cognitive domains but not others although the most important question of whether anesthetic agents actually cause long term neurodevelopmental effects in children has still not been answered results from recent studies will guide further studies necessary to inform clinical decision making in children\n",
