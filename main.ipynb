accumulation the vast majority of affected individuals are male on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings age of onset disease severity and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males in those with early progressive disease cns involvement manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration progressive airway disease and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life in those with slowly progressive disease the cns is not or is minimally affected although the effect of gag accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease additional findings in both forms of mps ii include short stature macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus macroglossia hoarse voice conductive and sensorineural hearing loss hepatosplenomegaly dysostosis multiplex spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis testing the diagnosis of mps ii is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2 sulfatase i2s enzyme activity in white cells fibroblasts or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in ids confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of gag testing the diagnosis of mps ii is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous ids pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing management treatment of manifestations interventions commonly include developmental occupational and physical therapy shunting for hydrocephalus tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy positive pressure ventilation cpap or tracheostomy carpal tunnel release cardiac valve replacement inguinal hernia repair hip replacement prevention of primary manifestations weekly enzyme replacement therapy ert with infusions of idursulfase elaprase a recombinant form of human iduronate 2 sulfatase is

document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing opening pressure on lumbar puncture and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease evaluation of relatives at risk while clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at risk males allows initiation of ert before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ert justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at risk male relatives genetic counseling mps ii is inherited in an x linked manner the
