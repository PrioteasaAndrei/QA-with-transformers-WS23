Individuals with VWS may have congenital paramedian lower lip fistulae, cleft lip, cleft palate, and submucous cleft palate. PPS is characterized by cleft lip, lower lip fistulae, webbing of the skin, bifid scrotum and cryptorchidism in males, hypoplasia of the labia majora in females, syndactyly of fingers and/or toes, anomalies of the skin around the nails, and other musculoskeletal anomalies. IRF6-related disorders can also be associated with neural tube defects and orofacial clefts. \n\nManagement of IRF6-related disorders may involve surgical treatment of lip pits, cleft lip, and palate, pediatric dentistry, orthodontia, speech therapy, feeding therapy, treatment of otitis media, physical therapy, orthopedic care, and surgical treatment for cryptorchidism. Surveillance for individuals with cleft lip and/or cleft palate may include regular assessments of nutritional intake, weight gain, otolaryngologic evaluation, audiologic evaluation, speech language pathology evaluation, dental evaluation, and routine dental evaluation throughout life.\n\nGenetic counseling for IRF6-related disorders involves identifying a heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 through molecular genetic testing.

These complications can impact the overall health and well-being of affected individuals in various ways. Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue. Middle ear dysfunction can cause hearing problems. Kyphosis, which is a forward curvature of the spine, can cause back pain and difficulty with mobility. Spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal, can lead to nerve compression and neurological symptoms. These complications may require various interventions such as adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, or tracheostomy for sleep apnea, pressure equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction, and spinal surgery for kyphosis and spinal stenosis. Additionally, individuals with achondroplasia may require modifications in their school and work settings to optimize their function, as well as educational support for socialization and school adjustment. Regular monitoring of height, weight, head circumference, and developmental milestones is also important. Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery due to their small pelvic size.']",reasoning,True
